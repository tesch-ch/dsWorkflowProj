## Getting to know Kubernets

Watch short 1h tutorial [Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4) and answer the following questions:
- What is Kubernetes?
- Why do we use it?
- What are key concepts and/or important pieces of terminology?

### Tutorial Notes
- K8s = Kubernetes
- There is a trend for to microservices
- Inherently linked to containering (i.e. docker...)
- We need a way to orchestrate those containers
- Those tools offer
  - high availability
  - scalability/performance
  - backup and restore capabilities

- Kubernets Architecture
  - Made up of 1+ master nodes, multiple worker nodes
  - (Worker) Node: virtual or physical machine
  - kubelet enables communication between containers
  - u can have multiple docker containers running on a node
  - Master Node runs an API Server: UI, API, CLI
  - There is a Virtual Network between master node and worker nodes ("fully connected")...
  - In production systems there will be multiple master nodes for managing nodes... (redundancy)
  - Main Components (9:30)
    - pod: smallest unit in kubernetes: creates running environment for docker container --> **Kubernetes abstracts container technology away**
      - **abstraction of containers**
      - Pod usually runs 1 application container
      - can run multiple (usually side/helper containers)
      **- Communication: each Pod gets own internal IP-Address**
      - Pod is ephemeral: Can die/crash easily -> will respawn with new IP adress
    - Service
      - Permanent IP address can be attached to each pod
      - On pod crash ip address will stay
      - There are external and internal services
      - IP Address: usually node ip and port number of service
    - Ingress: forwarding to service (for end user access)
    - ConfigMap: External Configuration of application
      - Contains URLs of database etc...
      - On changes we don't necessarily need to rebuild whole system
      - **For non confidential stuff only**
    - secret: Just like config map but for secret data, like passwords etc... **still encrypt with 3rd party stuff**
      - connect to pod enabling pods to read from secrets...
      - can be used as environment var...
    - Data Storage (vol)
      - attach a physical storage of local machine or remote to pods...
      - **kubernetes has not auto data backup etc...**
    - deploy
      - "blueprint" for apps...
      - in practice you create deployments
      - **Abstraction of pods**
      - Databases cannot be replicated via deployment
        - why? Databases have state (their data)
    - sts (statefulset)
      - for stateful apps like databases
      - --> can be complicated
    - **Deployment->stateLESS Apps, StatefulSET->stateFUL Apps or Databases**
      - DB are often hosted outside of kubernetes cluster
    - SUMMARY (25:00)
      - Pods: abstraction of containers
      - Service: communication
      - Ingress: route traffic into cluster
      - ConfigMap, Secret: external configuration
      - Volume: data persistance
      - Deployment, StatefulSet: replication
  - Kubernetes Configuration
    - API Server (Control Plane): talked to by e.g. kubectl --> YAML configuration
    - Describes desired state. Tink spec:replicas:2 If there is only 1, another one will be created...
    - Parts of configuration file
      - apiVersion
      - Kind
      - metadata
      - spec
      - status (automatically generated by kubernetes)
        - etcd holds status information for comparison
    - YAML indentation is important
    - store config file with code
  - Minikube
    - How to test on local machine?
    - One node cluster master processes and worker processes...
  - kubectl
    - command line tool for kubernetes clusters
    - establish connection to api server (send commands) via UI, API, or CLI (KUBECTL, very powerful)
  - Minikube install (36:00)
    - Set up dummy kubernetes cluster for trying stuff
  - Demo Project (41:24)
    - Mongo DB Database with Web Application
